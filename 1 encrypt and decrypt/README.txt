Hi!

Welcome to the magical cryptography workshop.
Do you have some secrets to encrypt? If so, you are in the right place!

*Part 1*
Write code (python is reccomended, but not necessary) that does the follows, as for a shift (caesar) cipher:
1. Encrypt (message, shift) returns ciphrtext
2. Decrypt (ciphertext, shift) returns plaintext

You may use this message, shift and ciphertext to check out your code:
message = "magical"
shift = 3
ciphertext = "pdjlfdo"

Good luck!


Recommended steps:
1. Implement Encrypt and try it on a single char with shift of 3
1. Implement Decrypt and try it on a single char with shift of 3
1. Improve the code to work with input 20 for shift and 'z' for message
1. Improve the code to work on a single lowercase word message
1. Improve the code to work on a single mixed-case word message
1. Improve the code to work on a message (deal with spaces)


Bonus:
- Try reusing code
